## Using the Canvas API ðŸš€

### Example: Retrieving Course Information
Hereâ€™s an example of how to retrieve course information using Python and the Canvas API:

```python
from canvasapi import Canvas

# Canvas API URL and Token
API_URL = "https://canvas.instructure.com"
API_TOKEN = "your-access-token-here"

# Initialize Canvas object
canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_TOKEN)

# Get a course by its ID
course_id = 12345  # Replace with your Course ID
course = canvas.get_course(course_id)

# Print course details
print(f"Course Name: {course.name}")
print(f"Course Code: {course.course_code}")
